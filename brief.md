# Frequently Asked Questions
 How long does carpet cleaning take to dry?
Drying time typically ranges from 4-8 hours, depending on the cleaning method, ventilation, and humidity levels. We use advanced equipment to ensure the fastest possible drying time.
 How often should I have my carpets professionally cleaned?
How often should I have my carpets professionally cleaned?”  
Answer: For most homes, professional cleaning is recommended every 12-18 months. However, high-traffic areas or homes with pets may benefit from more frequent cleaning, around every 6-8 months.
 Do you move furniture during cleaning?
Yes, we move most lightweight furniture. Heavy items like pianos, entertainment units, and filled bookcases typically remain in place. We place protective pads under furniture legs to protect your carpet.
 What cleaning methods do you use?
We use hot water extraction (steam cleaning) as our primary method, which is recommended by major carpet manufacturers. This deep cleaning process effectively removes dirt, allergens, and stains.
 Can you remove all stains?
Most stains can be removed with professional treatment. However, some stains may be permanent if they’ve already caused fabric damage or dye transfer. We assess each stain individually and advise on the best treatment approach.
 Are your cleaning products safe for children and pets?
Yes, we use eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning solutions that are safe for children, pets, and people with allergies. All products are professionally tested and certified.
 How should I prepare for carpet cleaning?
We recommend vacuuming beforehand and removing small items from the floor. Please point out areas of concern and ensure clear access to all areas requiring cleaning.
 How long should I wait before walking on cleaned carpets?
While carpets can be walked on immediately with protective covers we provide, we recommend minimising traffic for 6 hours. For upholstery, please allow 8-12 hours before normal use to ensure complete drying.
